I'm currently a student at UCLA. Here are some projects I have worked on. Most
of them are open source and what not so feel free to submit patches or email me
with any questions (most title links are to the github repository).

• <a href="http://www.arete.com">Real-time Image Registration</a> (2010)
  - Summer Internship at Aret&eacute; Associates
• <a href="http://github.com/jdegges/arsenal">Arsenal: distributed SFTP based file system</a> (2010)
  - My solution to redundant and distributed personal network storage. It
    allows any computer on your network to act as a dumb storage node. Any
    clients can use Arsenal to manage a battery of SSH servers. The Arsenal
    clients can be configured with the network topology with a simple XML file.
  - Currently Arsenal operates in read-only mode (so there is no way to lose
    data!)
  - One of the primary goals of the project (besides providing consolidated
    network storage) is to provide a solid and robust interface to your data.
    If Arsenal crashes your data will still be laid out logically on all disk
    drives so manual recovery is possible.
• <a href="http://github.com/jdegges/DNArm">DNArm: Parallel DNA Read Mapper</a> (2010)
  - Computational Genetics 124 class project (UCLA)
• <a href="http:///participatorysensing.org">StressChill/WeTap: Participatory Sensing with Android</a> (2009-2010)
  - WeTap: a participatory sensing campaign geared towards identifying,
    describing and mapping public drinking fountains.
  - StressChill: a participatory sensing campaign developed for a pilot LAUSD
    curriculum intended to give students exposure to the technical fields.
    Students can upload and categorize geotagged images of places that make
    them feel "Stressfull" or "Chillfull".
• <a href="http://github.com/jdegges/loomlib">loomlib: parallel data structures library</a> (2009)
  - Implemented several data structures for simplifying the development of
    multi-threaded applications.
  - Asynchronous queue/list.
  - Thread pool. Essentially an asynchronous queue of function pointers.
  - Pipeline. Designate different pipeline stages (or pumps) that all run
    concurrently to process data in a stream-like fashion.
  - Tree. A pipeline with branches where each node may have multiple children.
    Problems where a data flows is easily split and never joined work well with
    this paradigm.
• <a href="http://rippergame.com">Ripper Game: 3D Role Playing Game created with LightSpeed</a> (2009-2010)
• <a href="http://github.com/chenguo/coreutils">Parallel Sort</a>
  - Software Engineering 130 class project (UCLA)
  - We extended GNU Core Utilities sort to include parallel internal and
    external sorting algorithms.
• <a href="http://www.arete.com">Depth from Defocus</a> (2009)
  - Summer Internship at Aret&eacute; Associates
• <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/gumstixcens/Home">PIP: Portable Image Platform</a> (2008-2009)
• Multi-Tier Computing and Energy Profiling  (2008)
  - Developed a multi-tier vision algorithm for differentiating between
    pedestrian and vehicular movements which achieved overall power savings of
    50% and accuracy improvements of 30% vs. traditional methods.
• <a href="http://www.videolan.org/developers/x264.html">H.264/AVC Video Compression</a> (2008)
  - Google Summer of Code 2008
• Gumstix Nest Box Deployment  (2006-2007)
  - Deployed low powered audio recording devices and networked cameras into
    several nest boxes to monitor the nesting cycle of various bird species.
  - A detection and classification system was developed to determine the
    current nesting stage.
  - Adaptive sampling techniques were used to further reduce power consumption
    without significantly degrading classification.
• <a href="http://lecs.cs.ucla.edu/wiki/index.php/Joey_Degges#Cyclops_Project">Cyclops Pitfall Traps</a> (2006)
  - Built and deployed a network of low-powered wireless cameras into an array
    of pitfall traps.
  - One image was collected from each node every five minutes and aggregated on
    a nearby server for analysis.
  - A detector was implemented to raise alerts when objects fell into the trap.
  - Each node contained Cyclops and Mica2 boards and were programmed with
    EmStar and TinyOS.
